## NB: this overlay is deprecated, as me doesn't use Gentoo for three straight years. 

It doesn't meet current Gentoo requirements (see [here](https://bugs.gentoo.org/693268)), and can't be used anymore. This Git repository may be removed any time soon. If you by any chance used some of these ebuilds, move to another overlay immediately. 

#### Trollerlay â€” troller Gentoo overlay!

If I can't find something in main portage tree or in overlays, I'm writing a ebuild for myself and push it there. Maybe, this stuff will be useful for you too.

Use at your own risk, blah blah blah.
